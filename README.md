**NOTE:** I cannot offer support for this script. I got some reports from users that it does not work correctly in some situations, especially in Xcode 6 (please check the [Issues](https://github.com/ole/Storyboard-Strings-Extraction/issues)).

# Storyboard Strings Extraction

Shell script to automatically extract translatable strings from Xcode storyboards and update `.strings` files. [Original version](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=16060008&postcount=4) by MacRumors forum user mikezang. Slightly updated by Ole Begemann.

See my [accompanying blog post](http://oleb.net/blog/2013/02/automating-strings-extraction-from-storyboards-for-localization/) for details and usage instructions.

Until August 2014, this script lived as a Gist at [https://gist.github.com/ole/5007019](https://gist.github.com/ole/5007019). Please refer to that page for earlier issues and comments.
